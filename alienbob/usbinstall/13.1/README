Creating a USB installer for Slackware 13.1
===========================================

Please read http://alien.slackbook.org/blog/installing-slackware-using-usb-thumb-drive/
for an easy way to create a USB installer for Slackware 13.1.

I am not going to make a 13.1 version of the create_-multipartboot.sh script
which I have been maintining during several Slackware releases, because I think
the new usbimg2disk.sh script is easier to use and more versatile too.

Note: The "usbimg2disk.sh" script mentioned in my blog article is guaranteed
  to work on Slackware.  I have reports from people on other distros that the
  script does not always work for them. The morale: use Slackware!

Note: Windows users should read these instructions instead:
